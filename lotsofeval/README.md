The gigabookucis here is output from a custom build of lc0 value_extract. It contains the same positions as gigabook mentioned elsewhere, but in a format that lotsofeval can feed to lc0 easily.

lotsofeval is expected to be used with a standard normal boring lc0 build.

lotsofeval has two modes but I was lazy so I just comment out the part of code I don't need and recompile each time.
As committed, its in mode for converting the lc0 logfile output into evals.txt as useful for valuescoring.  Reverse the commenting to get the generating path.
